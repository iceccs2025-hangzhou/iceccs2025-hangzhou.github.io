                        <h3>Special Track/Issue on Open Environmental Software Systems Modelling</h3>


                        <h5>Introduction </h5>
                        <p>Nowadays, software-intensive systems such as cyber-physical systems and self-adaptive systems are radically transforming our daily lives, businesses, and industries. They have already started to become prominent in our daily life, in the form of self-driving cars, crop-spraying drones, and so on. Main excepted characteristics of such systems include: (1) constantly operating in open and dynamic environment, (2) continuously evolving throughout their lifecycles, including autonomous adaptation -- via learning -- to the operating environment, (3) elegantly handling various levels of internal uncertainty by e.g., employing AI/MI techniques, and external uncertainty from e.g., human interactions, uncertain information networks, etc., and (4) gracefully dealing with emerging issues (such as safety, security, and trustworthiness) that are unknown at the design time but may occur during their operations. </p>
                        <p>Therefore, traditional software engineering methodologies need to be revolutionized in order to develop intelligent software systems that operate in open environment. Particularly, modelling, which has been recognized as an effective mechanism in dealing with the complexity by raising the level of abstraction and facilitating automation in e.g., test/code generation, prediction of future behaviours, can still be an effective and principled mechanism for managing the ever-increasing complexity of engineering such systems. </p>
                        <p>In this special issue, we call for papers that present the state-of-the-art, the state-of-the-practice, and high-quality original research papers, in the area of open environmental software systems modelling. It solicits submissions describing results of theoretical, empirical, conceptual, and experimental software engineering research related to open environmental software system modelling. Topics of interests include but are not limited to: </p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Novel modelling methods and tools for embedded systems, cyber-physical systems, etc.</li>
                        <li>Modelling in emerging areas of machine learning, security, open source, and sustainability.</li>
                        <li>Modelling in the era of data: data for enabling AI/ML, and their applications in intelligent systems such as smart cities</li>
                        <li>Modelling methodologies for handling uncertainties.</li>
                        <li>Modelling of requirements, architecture, design, (open) environment, etc.</li>
                        <li>Model-based engineering, including analyses, prediction, simulation, verification and validation.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>Submission</h5>
                        <p>To speed up the review process, and to encourage people to join the Internetware 2020 conference (in Singapore), we setup two rounds of reviews: the Internetware conference round, and the SoSyM journal round. </p>

                        <p>In the Internetware conference round, authors are encouraged to submit their manuscripts to the Easychair submission <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=internetware2020">site</a> . You should choose “Open Environmental Software Systems Modelling Track” in Easychair. The submissions must have not been previously published or considered for publication elsewhere. Each submission must not exceed 10 pages for all text, figures, tables, and references. All submissions must be in English and in PDF format. Please use the 2019 ACM Master article template, as can be obtained from the ACM Proceedings Template pages. Each submission will receive at least three high-quality reviews from our PCs. Each accepted submission must be accompanied by a registration of at least one author and presented at Internetware 2020.    </p>

                        <p>As for the SoSyM journal round, only selected best papers from this special track will be invited to submit their extensions to the SoSyM special issue. Please do consult the SoSyM <a href="http://www.sosym.org/submission/" >website</a>  and get familiar with the SoSyM submission guidelines, especially the SoSyM Publication Quality Guidelines. The authors are expected to carefully address comments from the Internetware conference reviewers and prepare a response letter clearly stating the extension. Please note that an invitation to an extended submission does not guarantee its acceptance to the SoSyM special issue. </p>

                        <p>The SoSyM special issue submission site will be announced soon. </p>
