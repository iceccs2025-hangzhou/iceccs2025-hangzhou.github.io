                        <h3>Welcome to ICECCS 2025</h3>
                        <p>Driven by advancements in areas such as artificial intelligence, distributed systems, autonomous intelligent systems, and cyber-physical systems, complex computer systems increasingly shape every aspect of human life, from manufacturing and communications to healthcare, defense, transportation, and energy, the demand for advanced methodologies and tools is growing. These systems are often distributed across heterogeneous networks, leveraging vast amounts of data alongside emerging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning techniques. Recent trends, including the rise of large language models (LLMs) and embodied intelligence, have introduced additional challenges and opportunities in the engineering of such systems. The complexity of modern systems arises from dynamic operating environments, diverse functional requirements, and conflicting needs such as performance, scalability, security, dependability, and adaptability. These challenges are compounded by factors like real-time behavior, fault tolerance, robustness, and long-term sustainability, making the engineering of these systems a multidisciplinary effort.</p>
                        <p>The 29th International Conference on Engineering of Complex Computer Systems (ICECCS 2025) is a well-established event that has been held around the world for over 29 years. It aims to bring together experts from industry, academia, and government to exchange ideas on the engineering of intricate systems. We encourage contributions that tackle both theoretical and practical challenges, from long-term research agendas to near-term industry needs.</p>
                        <p>ICECCS is recognized as a CCF-C conference by the China Computer Federation (CCF) and holds a B ranking in the 2023 rankings of the Computing Research and Education Association of Australasia (CORE).</p>
