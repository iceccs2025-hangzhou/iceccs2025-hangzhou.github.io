            <h3>Welcome to ICECCS 2025</h3>
            <p>Driven by advancements in areas such as artificial intelligence, distributed systems, autonomous intelligent systems, and cyber-physical systems, complex computer systems increasingly shape every aspect of human life, from manufacturing and communications to healthcare, defense, transportation, and energy, the demand for advanced methodologies and tools is growing. These systems are often distributed across heterogeneous networks, leveraging vast amounts of data alongside emerging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning techniques. Recent trends, including the rise of large language models (LLMs) and embodied intelligence, have introduced additional challenges and opportunities in the engineering of such systems. The complexity of modern systems arises from dynamic operating environments, diverse functional requirements, and conflicting needs such as performance, scalability, security, dependability, and adaptability. These challenges are compounded by factors like real-time behavior, fault tolerance, robustness, and long-term sustainability, making the engineering of these systems a multidisciplinary effort.</p>
            <p>The 29th International Conference on Engineering of Complex Computer Systems (ICECCS 2025) is a well-established event that has been held around the world for over 29 years. It aims to bring together experts from industry, academia, and government to exchange ideas on the engineering of intricate systems. We encourage contributions that tackle both theoretical and practical challenges, from long-term research agendas to near-term industry needs.</p>
            <p>ICECCS is recognized as a CCF-C conference by the China Computer Federation (CCF) and holds a B ranking in the 2023 rankings of the Computing Research and Education Association of Australasia (CORE).</p>

            <h4><b>Submission and Publication</b></h4>
            <p>ICECCS 2025 accepts both full papers and short papers.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Full papers are divided into two categories: Technical Papers and Experience Reports. The papers submitted to both categories will be reviewed by the program committee members, and papers accepted in either category will be published in the conference proceedings. Technical papers should describe original research, and experience reports should present practical projects carried out in the industry, and reflect on the lessons learnt from them.</li>
              <li>Short paper submissions describe early-stage, ongoing or PhD research. All short papers will be reviewed by the program committee members, and accepted short papers will be published in the conference proceedings.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Submissions to the conference must not have been published or be concurrently considered for publication elsewhere. All submissions will be judged on the basis of originality, contribution to the field, technical and presentation quality, and relevance to the conference.</p>
            <p>Proceedings will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS). Submitted manuscripts should be in English and formatted in the style of LNCS format. Full papers should not exceed 20 pages (including bibliography, etc.), and short papers should not exceed 11 pages (including bibliography, etc.). All submissions should be in PDF format. Submissions not adhering to the specified format and length may be rejected immediately without review. Please prepare your manuscripts in accordance with the Springer LNCS guidelines: <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines" target="_blank">https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines</a></p>

                <h4>Abstract</h4>
                <p>The approach of failure-based testing refers to those software testing techniques that make use of the information about various aspects of failure patterns to do testing. Adaptive random testing belongs to this approach. In this presentation, we will explain the development and the potential of this approach. We believe that more and more work will be emerging from this field. Also discussed will include how failure-based testing aids debugging and program repair, and the role of failure-based testing used in testing AI systems.</p>
                <h4>Biography</h4>
                <p>Tsong Yueh Chen is currently a professor in software engineering at Swinburne University of Technology in Australia. His main research interest is on software testing. Chen is the inventor of adaptive random testing and metamorphic testing. He co-founded the field of failure-based testing with Fei-Ching Kuo, Robert Merkel and T. H. Tse. He is an IEEE Fellow and is the recipient of the ACM SIGSOFT Outstanding Research Award.</p>

                <h4>Abstract</h4>
                <p>The rapid integration of large vision-language models (VLMs) into intelligent agent systems has unlocked remarkable capabilities across domains. These systems promise autonomy, adaptability, and multimodal understanding, positioning them at the frontier of real-world AI deployments. However, as their complexity and reach grow, so do the security and trustworthiness challenges they face. In this talk, I will explore the security and trustworthiness issues of contemporary VLM-driven agent systems, focusing on a range of emerging threats from adversarial perception attacks to prompt injections. I will illustrate how these vulnerabilities can be exploited in practice and what risks they pose to safety, privacy, and reliability. Then I will discuss some potential defensive strategies to enhance the resilience of these systems. This talk aims to provoke both technical insight and critical reflection on the secure development of next-generation AI agents.</p>

            <h3>Hangzhou Gourmet</h3>
            <p>We are thrilled to have you here today to explore a delightful journey through the flavors of Hangzhou's culinary heritage. Each dish you’ll taste celebrates our culture and traditions, crafted with care and the finest ingredients. Let's introduce Longjing (Dragon Well) Tea, an iconic tea that is a perfect way to awaken your palate. West Lake Poached Fish is an appetizer for adjusting after long-distance travel. Dongpo Pork follows, a rich and savory block of meat that melts in your mouth. For a unique twist, we also present Longjing Tea Crisp, Beggar's Chicken, and Shrimps with Longjing Tea &mdash; my favorite, where the sweetness of the shrimp is elevated by the distinctive taste of Longjing tea. Anyway, there are many other light and fragrant desserts around Hangzhou, especially the West Lake area, infused with the delicate aroma of osmanthus flowers, which is a perfect finish to our culinary journey.</p>
