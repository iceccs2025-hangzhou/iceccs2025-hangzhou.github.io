                        <h3>Welcome to Internetware 2020</h3>
                        <p>Internet provides a global open infrastructure for exchanging and sharing of various resources for the
                        people all over the world. The rapid development and the wide application of Internet make it become a new
                        mainstream platform for software to be used, developed, deployed and executed. With the vision of
                        “Internet as computer”, many application styles such as pervasive computing, grid computing, service
                        computing and cloud computing occur on this open and dynamic environment. In order to support various new
                        application styles and accommodate the fundamental change of the underlying supporting platform, many
                        specific software technologies such as service-oriented architecture are proposed for current practices.
                        However, although these technologies are useful and popular, they are far from systematic and complete
                        because no uniformed software methodology and technology system like the object-oriented one is
                        provided.</p>
                        <p>Conceptually speaking, in order to adapt the software system to such a new environment, its structure
                        model should be autonomous, cooperative, situational, evolvable, emergent, trustworthy, etc. The software
                        entities dispersed on distributed nodes over the Internet, which evolved from objects in object-oriented
                        methodology to software components (component-based software development), now are further turned into
                        self-contained, autonomous and adaptive software services in service-oriented computing of state-of-arts.
                        These software entities are coordinated statically and dynamically in various kinds of interaction styles
                        (passively and actively) such as integration, cooperation, and orchestration to achieve flexible design
                        objectives. So a so-called “software-web” instead of information-web is weaved. This software-web as a
                        whole is able to perceive the changes of open, dynamic, and uncertain environment and respond them in the
                        way of transforming architectures. Furthermore, the flexible design objective of the software-web is
                        reflected by its exhibiting several compatible goal-directed behaviors according to its up-to-date
                        knowledge about the outside environment. A portmanteau term “Internetware” is used to denote the future
                        software-web in open and dynamic environment, which can be defined as follows: an Internetware system is a
                        software system consists of the self-contained, autonomous entities situated in the distributed nodes of
                        Internet and the coordinators connecting these entities statically and dynamically in various kinds of
                        interaction styles (passively and actively). As a whole, an Internetware system is able to perceive the
                        changes of open and dynamic environment such as Internet, respond to the changes in the way of
                        architectural transformation, and exhibit context-aware, adaptive and trustworthy behaviors in the open and
                        dynamic environment in order to meet its flexible design objectives. Internetware challenges many aspects
                        of software technologies, from operating platforms, programming models, to engineering approaches, etc.

                        <h5>Introduction</h5>


                        <p>With the Internetware paradigm, the software is architected like the Internet, developed with the Internet, operated on the Internet, and provided as services via the Internet. In the open, dynamic, and constantly changing environment of Internet, Internetware systems need to be autonomous, cooperative, situational, evolvable, emergent, and trustworthy. These requirements pose special challenges for software technologies to support the construction, deployment, and use of software applications based on Internet that not only of computers, but also of things and human users.</p>

                        <h3>Special Track/Issue on Intelligent Software Engineering (Journal of Information and Software Technology)</h3>
                        <p>Software systems have been playing important roles in business, scientific research, and our everyday lives. It is critical to improve both software productivity and quality, which are major challenges to software engineering researchers and practitioners. As developers work on a project, they leave behind many digital artifacts. These digital trails can provide insights into how software is developed and provide a rich source of information to help improve development practices. For instance, GitHub hosts more than 57M repositories, and is currently used by more than 20M developers. As another example, Stack Overflow has more than 3.9M registered users, 8.8M questions, and 41M comments. The productivity of software developers and testers can be improved using information from these repositories. 
                        </p>
                        <p>TIn recent years, intelligent software engineering has emerged as a promising means to address these challenges. In intelligent software engineering, Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques (e.g., deep learning) have been frequently applied to discover knowledge or build intelligent tools from software artifacts (e.g., specifications, source code, documentations, execution logs, code commits and bug reports) to improve software quality and development process (e.g., to obtain the insights for the causes leading to poor software quality, and to help the managers optimize the resources for better productivity). And these techniques have shown a great success in addressing various software engineering problems (e.g., code generation, code recommendation, and bug fix and repair). Therefore, intelligent software engineering has attracted great attention in both software engineering and AI communities.  
                        </p>
                        <p>We invite the submission of high-quality papers describing original and significant work in all areas of intelligent software engineering including (but not limited to): 1) Methodological and technical foundations of intelligent software engineering, 2) Approaches and techniques for knowledge discovery in various software artefacts, and 3) Applications of AI techniques to facilitate specialized tasks in software engineering. Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

                        <h3>Special Track/Issue on Open Environmental Software Systems Modelling</h3>


                        <h5>Introduction </h5>
                        <p>Nowadays, software-intensive systems such as cyber-physical systems and self-adaptive systems are radically transforming our daily lives, businesses, and industries. They have already started to become prominent in our daily life, in the form of self-driving cars, crop-spraying drones, and so on. Main excepted characteristics of such systems include: (1) constantly operating in open and dynamic environment, (2) continuously evolving throughout their lifecycles, including autonomous adaptation -- via learning -- to the operating environment, (3) elegantly handling various levels of internal uncertainty by e.g., employing AI/MI techniques, and external uncertainty from e.g., human interactions, uncertain information networks, etc., and (4) gracefully dealing with emerging issues (such as safety, security, and trustworthiness) that are unknown at the design time but may occur during their operations. </p>
                        <p>Therefore, traditional software engineering methodologies need to be revolutionized in order to develop intelligent software systems that operate in open environment. Particularly, modelling, which has been recognized as an effective mechanism in dealing with the complexity by raising the level of abstraction and facilitating automation in e.g., test/code generation, prediction of future behaviours, can still be an effective and principled mechanism for managing the ever-increasing complexity of engineering such systems. </p>
                        <p>In this special issue, we call for papers that present the state-of-the-art, the state-of-the-practice, and high-quality original research papers, in the area of open environmental software systems modelling. It solicits submissions describing results of theoretical, empirical, conceptual, and experimental software engineering research related to open environmental software system modelling. Topics of interests include but are not limited to: </p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Novel modelling methods and tools for embedded systems, cyber-physical systems, etc.</li>
                        <li>Modelling in emerging areas of machine learning, security, open source, and sustainability.</li>
                        <li>Modelling in the era of data: data for enabling AI/ML, and their applications in intelligent systems such as smart cities</li>
                        <li>Modelling methodologies for handling uncertainties.</li>
                        <li>Modelling of requirements, architecture, design, (open) environment, etc.</li>
                        <li>Model-based engineering, including analyses, prediction, simulation, verification and validation.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>Submission</h5>
                        <p>To speed up the review process, and to encourage people to join the Internetware 2020 conference (in Singapore), we setup two rounds of reviews: the Internetware conference round, and the SoSyM journal round. </p>

                        <p>In the Internetware conference round, authors are encouraged to submit their manuscripts to the Easychair submission site (https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=internetware2020). You should choose “Open Environmental Software Systems Modelling Track” in Easychair. The submissions must have not been previously published or considered for publication elsewhere. Each submission must not exceed 10 pages for all text, figures, tables, and references. All submissions must be in English and in PDF format. Please use the 2019 ACM Master article template, as can be obtained from the ACM Proceedings Template pages. Each submission will receive at least three high-quality reviews from our PCs. Each accepted submission must be accompanied by a registration of at least one author and presented at Internetware 2020.    </p>

                        <p>As for the SoSyM journal round, only selected best papers from this special track will be invited to submit their extensions to the SoSyM special issue. Please do consult the SoSyM website (http://www.sosym.org/submission/) and get familiar with the SoSyM submission guidelines, especially the SoSyM Publication Quality Guidelines. The authors are expected to carefully address comments from the Internetware conference reviewers and prepare a response letter clearly stating the extension. Please note that an invitation to an extended submission does not guarantee its acceptance to the SoSyM special issue. </p>

                        <p>The SoSyM special issue submission site will be announced soon. </p>
