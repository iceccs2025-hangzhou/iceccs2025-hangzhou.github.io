                        <h3>Welcome to Internetware 2020</h3>
                        <p>Internet provides a global open infrastructure for exchanging and sharing of various resources for the
                        people all over the world. The rapid development and the wide application of Internet make it become a new
                        mainstream platform for software to be used, developed, deployed and executed. With the vision of
                        “Internet as computer”, many application styles such as pervasive computing, grid computing, service
                        computing and cloud computing occur on this open and dynamic environment. In order to support various new
                        application styles and accommodate the fundamental change of the underlying supporting platform, many
                        specific software technologies such as service-oriented architecture are proposed for current practices.
                        However, although these technologies are useful and popular, they are far from systematic and complete
                        because no uniformed software methodology and technology system like the object-oriented one is
                        provided.</p>
                        <p>Conceptually speaking, in order to adapt the software system to such a new environment, its structure
                        model should be autonomous, cooperative, situational, evolvable, emergent, trustworthy, etc. The software
                        entities dispersed on distributed nodes over the Internet, which evolved from objects in object-oriented
                        methodology to software components (component-based software development), now are further turned into
                        self-contained, autonomous and adaptive software services in service-oriented computing of state-of-arts.
                        These software entities are coordinated statically and dynamically in various kinds of interaction styles
                        (passively and actively) such as integration, cooperation, and orchestration to achieve flexible design
                        objectives. So a so-called “software-web” instead of information-web is weaved. This software-web as a
                        whole is able to perceive the changes of open, dynamic, and uncertain environment and respond them in the
                        way of transforming architectures. Furthermore, the flexible design objective of the software-web is
                        reflected by its exhibiting several compatible goal-directed behaviors according to its up-to-date
                        knowledge about the outside environment. A portmanteau term “Internetware” is used to denote the future
                        software-web in open and dynamic environment, which can be defined as follows: an Internetware system is a
                        software system consists of the self-contained, autonomous entities situated in the distributed nodes of
                        Internet and the coordinators connecting these entities statically and dynamically in various kinds of
                        interaction styles (passively and actively). As a whole, an Internetware system is able to perceive the
                        changes of open and dynamic environment such as Internet, respond to the changes in the way of
                        architectural transformation, and exhibit context-aware, adaptive and trustworthy behaviors in the open and
                        dynamic environment in order to meet its flexible design objectives. Internetware challenges many aspects
                        of software technologies, from operating platforms, programming models, to engineering approaches, etc.

                        <p>With the Internetware paradigm, the software is architected like the Internet, developed with the Internet, operated on the Internet, and provided as services via the Internet. In the open, dynamic, and constantly changing environment of Internet, Internetware systems need to be autonomous, cooperative, situational, evolvable, emergent, and trustworthy. These requirements pose special challenges for software technologies to support the construction, deployment, and use of software applications based on Internet that not only of computers, but also of things and human users.</p>
